William Shakespeare (UK /ˈʃeɪkspɪər/;[1] 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)[nb 1] was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[2] He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".[3][nb 2] His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays,[nb 3] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain.\/n\/nHis plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[4] On 23 January 2013 researchers even encoded the complete sonnets of Shakespeare onto a single strand of synthetic DNA.\/n\/n[5]
Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon.\/n\/nAt the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith.\/n\/nBetween 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men.\/n\/nHe appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later.\/n\/nFew records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[6]This article is about the poet and playwright./n/n For other persons of the same name, see William Shakespeare (disambiguation)./n/n For other uses of "Shakespeare", see Shakespeare (disambiguation).

Joyce in Zurich, c. 1918



James Augustine[1] Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist and poet, considered to be one of the most influential writers in the modernist avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nJoyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he perfected.\n\nOther major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939).\n\nHis complete oeuvre also includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.
Joyce was born into a middle class family in Dublin, where he excelled as a student at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, then at University College Dublin.\n\nIn his early twenties he emigrated permanently to continental Europe, living in Trieste, Paris and Zurich.\n\nThough most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe does not extend far beyond Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there; Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city.\n\nShortly after the publication of Ulysses he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world.\n\nIn the particular is contained the universal."[2]This article is about the 20th-century writer.\n\n For other people with the same name, see James Joyce (disambiguation).
